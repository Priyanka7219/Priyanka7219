<!-- ## Background üí¨

I have a **Bachelor of Technology** degree in **Metallurgical and Materials Engineering** from **Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur (India).** During my time there, I extensively worked on Materials Science research related to various topics right from Magnesium Alloys for Aerospace applications to Biomass derived Super-Capacitors. My work at **National University of Singapore** even resulted in a ***paper at a leading publication in my research field***. I learnt that everything ultimately comes down to the Structure-Property-Processing relationship which means that the same material could be structured in different ways and for different applications. Curious to work on ways we could model materials to accelerate property prediction, I dwelled deeper into ***machine learning*** and realised that I was more curious about this field and wanted to move beyond my undergraduate major. 

## Professional Experience üî≠

Quick to pivot into ML and Analytics and get my hands dirty, I started working as a **Business Analyst at Novartis** right after graduation. The span of 2 exciting years cemented my interest in understanding how data drove insights. I have worked majorly on ***anaytics*** related to ***effectiveness of marketing campaigns for brands catering to the US and Switzerland.*** I was promoted within a year and have received multiple performance based rewards for my contribution. Due to which I was given the opportunity to lead the Analytics and Operations team of 5 (I was the youngest in the team!) of one of the marquee projects at Novartis called the Next-Gen Engagement where I was the direct point of contact with our client.

## What do I bring to the table? ‚ö°

- I have worked majorly in **SQL** and **Python** 
  - Python Libraries I'm familiar with:
      1. **Data Wrangling:** Pandas, Numpy
      2. **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
      3. **Web scraping:** BeautifulSoup4, Requests
      4. **Natural Language Processing:** NLTK

- I have conducted **A/B testing** to understand the effect of AI based predictions in modifying physician prescription writing behaviour

- I am familiar with **Snowflake** environment in handling millions of rows of data and plugging them into Alteryx to build extensive worklows for data ingestion and manipulation

- I love **Automating** things even if it takes me hours to accomplish the task but I will NOT resort to monotonous work. Some mini projects I worked on at Novartis (not my direct responsibility) are:

    - I built and maintained **VBA** codes to automate pulling data from multiple repositories everyday and saving into respective folders that can be accessed by **Alteryx** to run different workflows. It would also upload directly into **Snowflake** tables
    
    - I built **Alteryx** workflows to check for data inconsistencies and report errors as csv files which would tell you exactly what went wrong and which rows were affected. This was super helpful to our team because we could immediately go back to the source and work with the data teams to correct the production databases (yikes!)
    
    - I built **Microsoft Power App flows** to automate sending emails to my manager regarding deliverables or send out promotional emails for the Quiz club I was part of
